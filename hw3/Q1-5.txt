1. 
What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a lightweight programming language commonly used by web developers to add dynamic interactions to web pages, applications, servers, and even games.

Interpreted languages: The code is executed line by line at runtime by an interpreter. They don't require compilation before execution.
Compiled languages: The code is transformed into machine code by a compiler before it can be executed.

2. 
Dynamically typed vs statically typed languages:
Dynamically typed languages: type checking is performed at runtime, means that the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.
Statically typed languages: recognizes different data types (numbers, strings, etc.), but doesn't use them too strictly, trying to convert data when it seems reasonable

Strongly vs weakly typed languages:
Strongly typed: Variables are restricted to one type, and implicit conversions are limited (e.g., Python, Java).
Weakly typed: Variables can change types easily, and implicit type conversions are common (e.g., JavaScript).

3.
var: old school, global+function scoped, redeclarable   
let: block scoped, redeclarable
const: block scoped, not declarable 

4.
Anonymous function: A function without a name.
First-class functions: if functions in that language are treated like other variables
Higher-order functions: function that returns a function or takes other functions as arguments is called a.
Callback functions: passed as an argument to another function to be called later
